To denoise the stock closing price data (AKBNK, KSCHOL, MGROS, ULKER, THYAO) and subsequently determine the best deep learning model (i.e., perform hyperparameter optimization) for each Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) obtained, the code file named 'Denoising and hyperparameter optimization.py' should be executed first. Following this, the '2LE-BO-DeepTrade_Model_Training.py' code should be run to perform model training and analyze model performance both statistically and through profitability analysis using the developed PLR-based trading strategy.
